# BirdSpeciesClassification
This project focuses on the classification of bird species based on bone type features. Using machine learning techniques, the goal is to predict the species of a bird based on structural characteristics of its bones, such as bone density, shape, and size.The dataset contains various bird species, and the task is to build a classifier that can accurately identify the species from bone features.

## Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing raw data to handle missing values, normalize features, and ensure consistency.
Feature Extraction: Analysis of bone characteristics, such as density, mass, and measurements, as input features for classification.
Modeling: Application of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Neural Networks, for classification tasks.
Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the models using grid search and cross-validation to optimize performance.
## Technologies:
Python
pandas, NumPy
scikit-learn
TensorFlow/Keras (for neural networks)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains various bird species with features extracted from their bone type.
